This is my submission for the freeCodaCamp assigment https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/request-header-parser-microservice

I put an index.js both in the root and in the views folder, and a style.css in the root folder, but since I had already submitted the assignment and got it passed on freeCodeCamp, I decided to leave the files in this repository in the state that they were at the timepoint for my submission to reflect how that submission actually was.
